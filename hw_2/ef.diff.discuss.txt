At the meeting the CEO [-discuss>>dicussed+} with us about [-the　company　issue>>issues　of　the　company+} .
Generally all [-dicussing>>discussions+} are confidential and nothing have to leave from room .
That is why green business is [-getting　force　and-] taking place in many companies [-dicussion-] .
